Answer based (Do any one from  either 1 or 2 and any three from 3,4,5,6,7):

1.You need to scale your backend services dynamically based on usage, without maintaining a traditional server infrastructure. How would you use serverless technologies to achieve this?
2.Your application requires real-time updates (e.g., notifications, live chats). How would you implement real-time communication in a MERN application?


(Do any three)
3.Your application is slowing down due to repeated queries to the database for commonly accessed data. How would you implement distributed caching to improve performance?
4.Your application needs to scale horizontally to handle increasing user requests across multiple servers. How would you design your Node.js backend for horizontal scaling?
5.You need to implement role-based access control (RBAC) for an API where different roles (admin, user, guest) have varying access to resources. How would you design middleware in Express to enforce RBAC securely and efficiently?
6.You need to build a real-time notification system in React, where notifications are pushed to users without needing to refresh the page. How would you integrate WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) with React to achieve this?
7.Your Node.js server is running out of memory under high loads, and garbage collection is causing performance issues. How would you diagnose memory leaks and optimize memory usage in a large-scale Node.js application?
